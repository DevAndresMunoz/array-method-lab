# Array Method Lab - TDD

- Fork the repository
- Clone down to your local machine
- Create and move to a branch called `array-methods/challenge-1`
- Add your template `.gitignore` file. 
- Run `npm i` at the root of your project.
- Create a file called `src/arrayMethods.js`
- Remember you'll need to export your custom function to make it available to the tests. This will be expanded as you write each function and complete each challenge.

``` javascript

module.exports = {
    swapFirstAndLast
};

```

- Copy and paste your work from your solo lab in class. Refactor or debug as necessary. Continue to next step once your test is passing.
- Commit, push to GitHub, and create a pull request back to YOUR main (not my main) branch.
- Merge your code
- In your terminal, checkout / move back to your main.
- Pull your remote MAIN branch code down to your main.
- Create and move to a branch following the pattern for the next method.

## Commit Often

Be sure to commit to your repo after every passing test. 

## How to Run Your Tests

Use the command `npm test` to run your tests in your terminal.
If you do not want or need to run certain texts, you can comment them out of the test file. Otherwise, you will not touch the test file.
